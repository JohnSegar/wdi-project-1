### Introduction
SPACEY is a Tetris inspired block breaker game, with a high score being the main aim. It was built with Javascript and styled with CSS. It was built for my first project during the WDI course at GA.

### How to play
The rules are simple. Use the left and right arrow keys to navigate a block to the bottom of the grid. Matching 3 blocks of the same colour will cause them to disappear.

### Technologies
HTML, CSS and Javascript (and JQuery) were the main components used to build the game.
